/*
 * NOTES
 * ngAnnotate
 * snippets/templates should be used for new angular functions
 * 
 * source maps
 * source maps are generated for both dev and dist because
 * all the css/javascript files are concatenated
 * dev is left as is, dist is uglified
 * I am assuming automated deployments know to exclude *.map files
